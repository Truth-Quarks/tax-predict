## taxPredict

taxPredict should predict the taxes on a home given a specific township and the amount paid for the house.

In broad strokes, it will
  have df$c(assessment, price, naive_Sales_Ratio, adj_Sales_Ratio, county, township code, township name, class) <- create in advance
  take as an input a choice of either naive or adjusted sales ratio
  calculate a predicted sales ratio SR_hat for a given price by:
    using lm to model the way sales ratio varies by price within the township
    using the mean sales ratio if there are too few data points for lm
    using lm with county-wide data instead if there are no data points (and print a notice)
  predicting an assessment = SR_hat * input$price
  predicting an annual tax = assessment * twpTaxRate 
  And adjusting by average annual tax increase (calculated separately)
